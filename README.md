It's a game. About unicorns. They run.


## Background
I decided to start this project for a several reasons. Mainly, I love games. I always have. I remember waiting up to 20 minutes for
the family Spectrum to load games from tape. Playing very simple side-scrollers such as [Punchy](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0003939) or pseudo-top-down games like [Alcatraz Harry](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0000137).

Then I was lucky enough to get given a NES one Christmas, and a Sega Master System the next. The step up in graphics and gameplay was phenomenal. 

Then there was the Sega Mega-Drive which to my mind was the greatest console ever. This console saw the birth of
so many things that we now take for granted in modern video games; The FIFA franchise, 3D first-person shooters (Zero Tolerance anyone?), epic RPGs and dungeon crawlers (Shining in the Darkness). 

The Mega-Drive also delivered the 2 best games ever created, Jungle Strike and Flashback. Like I said, the greatest games ever. EVER.

Secondly, I love programming. I always have. I'm lucky enough to develop software as a job, and when I finish at the end of the day I come home and code long into the night. I have looked into game development in the past but have struggled to dedicate the time to learning the various aspects of making a game. However, a couple of weeks ago I stumbled across a HackerNews link on Facebook about a guy who had created a YouTube series on making a Super Mario clone using JavaScript. Now, my own lingua franca is JavaScript so I was really looking forward to watching these videos. If anyone else is interested, the guy is called Pontus Alexander and his YouTube show is called Meth Meth Method. Hit him up on Twitter via @pomle.

Lastly, without sounding like "overly pushy parent", I would really like for my kids to get into coding. They all love playing video games and I would like them to gain an appreciation if not a basic understanding about how games are made. It's not necessarily about learning to write code, but learning how to think. This sounds like a strange thing to say but I think having an analytical, quizzical mind will help them in all aspects of their life.

## The Project
So the project is called Unicorn Run. The plan for the design is a bit nebulous at the moment as there is a huge dependency on
me finishing the YouTube video series. Once I get to this stage then I can concentrate more on the storyline that the game will follow.
